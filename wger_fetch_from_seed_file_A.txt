This increased range of motion can also help to improve shoulder stability and mobility. Additionally, parallettes push-ups engage the core muscles more than traditional push-ups, as the instability of the parallettes requires greater activation of the core muscles to maintain proper form.\n\nThe added challenge of balancing on the parallettes also requires greater upper body strength and control, making parallettes push-ups a more advanced variation of the traditional push-up.
